# CSE 517 - Homework 1 #

I have coded everything in a jupyter notebook. To run it, you should launch it & click run all.

There are several utility functions I have coded before reaching the language modeling part.

3 different classes defined for uni-gram, bi-gram and tri-gram models which return the uni-gram count, bi-gram count, tri-gram count dictionaries. Also, they have methods defined to calculate respective n-gram sentence log probability.

add_k_smoothing & linear interpolation functions are defined at the end.
